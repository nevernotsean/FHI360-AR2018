                                <p>As a young girl in Jordan, Samira Saeed Mouawwad watched her neighbors tend to their
                                    bees
                                    and pull the honey from the hives. Over the years, her interest in beekeeping grew.
                                    When
                                    Mouawwad and her husband began to struggle financially, she decided to transform her
                                    childhood interest into a business. “I took many training courses before I was able
                                    to
                                    master beekeeping,” says Mouawwad. “Now I import bees from abroad, nurture them,
                                    grow
                                    them and make pure honey.”

                                    Mouawwad, who is one of the first women in her community to earn a living from
                                    beekeeping, improved her business skills when
                                    she participated in the USAID Jordan Local Enterprise Support (LENS) home-based
                                    business
                                    training. With new skills and confidence, Mouawwad was able to take her business to
                                    the
                                    next level.

                                    Mouawwad learned food safety, packaging and marketing tips to connect with
                                    customers. “The topic I found most valuable was
                                    food safety, because it’s something home-based business owners often neglect and
                                    know

                                    Many home-based businesses are run exclusively by women, yet women entrepreneurs
                                    face more challenges than their male counterparts.
                                    LENS is empowering women like Mouawwad to create their own opportunities and map a
                                    future
                                    for themselves that they might not have thought possible. “The focus on small and
