<h1 class="drawer-title">Groundbreaking contraceptive technologies</h1>
<p>More than 200 million women living in low-income regions of the world do not want to become pregnant but are not using effective contraceptive methods. For some of these women, access to contraception is limited; for others, available methods are not acceptable or affordable. FHI 360's research is creating important <strong>global</strong> inroads in expanding access to quality, affordable and acceptable new contraceptive methods for those most in need. </p>
<p>Since 2013, FHI 360's work under our Contraceptive Technology Innovation (CTI) Initiative has strived to advance the development and evaluation of game changing innovations that offer safe, effective, low-cost, easy-to-use and appealing contraceptives to women. The work focuses on existing technology gaps by developing products with attributes that women want but are not available among current family planning options.</p>
<p>In 2018, the research continued to focus on creating novel contraceptive options by adapting innovative drug delivery platforms being studied for other therapeutic areas &mdash; including a biodegradable microneedle patch, biodegradable implants and longer-acting self-injectables. CTI is also evaluating a smaller copper intrauterine device. Collaboration with product development scientists at universities, small biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and manufacturing groups and service delivery organizations is a hallmark of our inclusive research model that quickly moves innovative ideas through development to production.</p>
<p>FHI 360 also continues to generate evidence to determine how expanded access to the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) &mdash; a safe, long-acting, highly effective contraceptive &mdash; could potentially increase contraceptive choice for women in developing countries. The LNG-IUS is already popular among women in many high-income countries and provides both contraceptive and noncontraceptive benefits. FHI 360 is expanding information to increase funders' and decision-makers' understanding of the potential value of adding the LNG-IUS to the contraception choices women have in sub-Saharan Africa. The information could also help inform national introduction and scale-up plans.</p>
