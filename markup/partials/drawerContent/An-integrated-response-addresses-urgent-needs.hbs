<h1 class="drawer-title">An integrated response addresses urgent needs</h1> 
<p class="mb0"><strong class="uppercase">Yemen</strong></p>
<p>The civil war in <strong>Yemen</strong> has persisted for four years and resulted in the world's worst humanitarian disaster, with roughly 4 of 5 Yemenis in urgent need of assistance. The conflict has caused widespread food insecurity and malnutrition, further straining the basic health care system to the breaking point.</p>
<p>In 2018, FHI 360 began working with communities near the front lines of the conflict. Our assessments identified a severe need for assistance in the coastal western districts of Dhubab, Al Mokha and Al Khawkhah. Until recently, these areas were inaccessible to international organizations. </p>
<p>FHI 360's integrated approach is well suited to humanitarian emergencies and to fostering collaboration with community stakeholders, the United Nations, and government institutions to identify and prioritize needs.  </p>
<p>Our first priority in Yemen was to restore access to critical primary health care services, starting by rehabilitating the Al Ghaded Health Center in Ta'iz, a facility that had been partially destroyed and was unable to function. Simultaneously, FHI 360 worked with the Al Mokha and Al Khawkhah Maternal and Child Health centers to meet rapidly increasing demand because of the influx of internally displaced people and lack of technical, financial and administrative support from the central government.  </p>
<p>Our assistance included ensuring the availability of qualified health workers; building technical capacity of health staff, including training midwives, nurses and clinicians on topics such as basic emergency obstetric and newborn care and community management of acute malnutrition; providing essential medicines; upgrading cold chain capacity; and improving water supply, sanitation and waste management systems.  </p>
<h2>From crisis to resilience</h2>
<p>FHI 360 is committed to drawing upon our depth and breadth of experience in building local capacities and evidence for long-term development solutions. We apply lessons learned in international development work to create pathways for crisis-affected communities to initiate recovery and build resilience. Our work in Yemen continues to build a bridge between emergency response and long-term recovery.</p>
