  Business is good for 38-year-old Nguyen Van Huy.* A motorbike taxi driver, Huy weaves and honks through the clogged
  streets of Hanoi. He makes around 5 million Vietnamese dong per month (US$215), enough to support his wife and
  nine-year-old daughter. “I feel I have a normal life,” says Huy.
</p>

<p>
  It has been 10 years since Huy received the news that he has HIV, which he believes he contracted from injecting
  drugs. “I was very sick at that time,” says Huy, who was put on lifesaving antiretroviral therapy (ART) that he
  continues to take today.
</p>

<p>
  People with HIV need lifelong treatment, but those who start ART early and stay on treatment are able to lead healthy
  lives and are unlikely to transmit HIV, which is critical to managing the epidemic. Vietnam is home to nearly a
  quarter million people living with HIV, with a large portion of infections concentrated among key populations,
  including people who inject drugs. Of the 132,000 people living with HIV and on treatment in Vietnam, 94 percent have
  suppressed viral loads, which eliminates the likelihood of sexually transmitting HIV.

  Transition to domestic financing for long-term sustainability
</h2>
<p>
  For years, ART has been supported in Vietnam via international aid, much of it through the U.S. President’s Emergency
  Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). As Vietnam’s economy grows and becomes less dependent on aid, the government has been
  developing a transition plan to manage its HIV care and treatment services and to finance 100 percent of the cost of
  ART by 2020, using social health insurance and provincial budgets.
</p>
<p>
  Key goals in the transition included revising the social health insurance law and benefits package to cover funding
  for HIV treatment and integrate HIV clinics into the public health system, as well as procuring antiretroviral
  medications through the social health insurance program and creating procedures for HIV services reimbursement. The
  number of HIV patients enrolled in social health insurance increased from 40 percent in 2014 to 90 percent by the end
  of 2018.
</p>
<p>
  The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has supported this transition through the USAID Sustainable HIV
  Response from Technical Assistance (<a
    href="https://www.fhi360.org/projects/sustainable-hiv-response-technical-assistance-shift">USAID SHIFT</a>) project.
  USAID SHIFT builds upon the success of the Sustainable Management of the HIV/AIDS Response and Transition to Technical
  Assistance (<a
    href="https://www.fhi360.org/projects/sustainable-management-hivaids-response-and-transition-technical-assistance-smart-ta">SMART-TA</a>)
  program, which transformed the way HIV prevention, care and treatment services are delivered in
  Vietnam.
</p>
<p>
  USAID SHIFT has partnered with provincial leaders to develop roadmaps to ensure that health facilities become
  certified to deliver services covered by the social health insurance program. The project conducts rigorous quality
  assessments and financial analyses of health facility expenditures and personnel to identify cost-efficiencies and
  staffing needs. Doctors, nurses, lab technicians, counselors and pharmacists are trained to ensure that patients
  understand the importance of social health insurance and enroll. Patients receive support developing individual
  continuation treatment plans to ensure that they adhere to their treatment regimens. These plans are regularly updated
  and include social health insurance as key to ensuring sustainable care.
</p>
<p>
  USAID also developed national guidelines for data collection and is upgrading the national health information system
  for improved monitoring of the epidemic and social health insurance usage. Separate data systems for outreach,
  testing, treatment and social health insurance enrollment are now linked to ensure that people who need services
  receive them. As a result of USAID SHIFT support, health providers can now access accurate and timely data through
  dashboards.
</p>
<p>
  Now, Huy has successfully enrolled in social health insurance and will continue to receive ART for free. “Today, I
  feel good and my health is much improved,” he says. “I always have hope there will be a cure for HIV, but until that
  time, I will continue to take my medications so I can stay healthy for my daughter and wife.”
