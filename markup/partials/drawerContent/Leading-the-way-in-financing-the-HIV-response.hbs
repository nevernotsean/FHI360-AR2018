He makes around 5 million Vietnamese dong per month (US$215), enough to support his wife and nine-year-old daughter. "I feel I have a normal life," says Huy. </p>
<p>It has been 10 years since Huy received the news that he had HIV, which he believes he contracted from injecting drugs. "I was very sick at that time," says Huy, who was put on lifesaving antiretroviral therapy (ART) that he continues to take today. </p>
<p>People with HIV need lifelong treatment, but those who start ART early and stay on treatment are better able to lead healthy lives and are unlikely to transmit HIV, which is critical to managing the epidemic. <strong>Vietnam</strong> has one of the lowest HIV prevalence rates (0.23 percent) among countries receiving support from the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) but is home to nearly a quarter million people living with HIV, with a large portion of infections concentrated among key populations, including people who inject drugs. Of the 132,000 people living with HIV and on treatment in Vietnam, 94 percent have suppressed viral loads, which eliminates the likelihood of sexually transmitting HIV. </p>
<h2>A roadmap for sustainability</h2>
<p>For years, ART has been offered in Vietnam free of charge via international aid, much of it through PEPFAR. As Vietnam’s economy grows and becomes less dependent on aid, the government has developed a transition plan to manage its HIV care and treatment services and to finance 100 percent of the cost of ART by 2020, using social health insurance (SHI) and provincial budgets.</p>
<p>Key goals in the transition included revising the social health insurance law and benefits package to cover funding for HIV treatment and integrate HIV clinics into the public health system, as well as procuring antiretroviral medications though the SHI program and creating procedures for HIV services reimbursement. The number of HIV patients enrolled in SHI increased from 40 percent in 2014 to 90 percent by the end of 2018.</p>
<p>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has supported this transition through the Sustainable HIV Response from Technical Assistance (<a href="https://www.fhi360.org/projects/sustainable-hiv-response-technical-assistance-shift" target="_blank">USAID SHIFT</a>) project. USAID SHIFT builds upon the success of the Sustainable Management of the HIV/AIDS Response and Transition to Technical Assistance (<a href="https://www.fhi360.org/news/hiv-project-vietnam-improved-patient-treatment-and-health-system" target="_blank">SMART-TA</a>) program, which transformed the way HIV prevention, care and treatment services are delivered in Vietnam.</p>
<p>The project has partnered with provincial leaders to develop roadmaps to ensure that health facilities become certified to deliver SHI-eligible services. The project conducts rigorous quality assessments and financial analyses of health facility expenditures and personnel to identify cost-efficiencies and staffing needs. Doctors, nurses, lab technicians, counselors and pharmacists are trained to ensure patients understand the importance of SHI and enroll. Patients receive support developing individual continuation treatment plans to ensure they adhere to their treatment regimens. These plans are regularly updated and include SHI as key to ensuring sustainable care.</p>
<p>USAID also developed national guidelines for data collection and is upgrading the national health information system for improved monitoring of the epidemic and SHI usage. Separate data systems for outreach, testing, treatment and SHI enrollment are now linked to ensure that people who need services receive them. As a result of USAID SHIFT support, health providers can now access accurate and timely data through dashboards.</p>
<p>Now, Huy has successfully enrolled in SHI and will continue to receive his ARVs for free.  "Today, I feel good and my health is much improved," he says. "I always have hope there will be a cure for HIV, but until that time, I will continue to take my medications so I can stay healthy for my daughter and wife."</p>
