                  <p>We live in an era of unprecedented prosperity with plenty of evidence of progress in addressing human development needs. Yet, global trends are placing many of these gains at risk. With the global population expected to reach 8 billion by 2023, it is easy to believe the world’s problems are too big to overcome.</p> 
                  <p>The impact of climate change looms larger every day, while the outbreak of deadly epidemics, political instability and crippling unemployment have given rise to a wave of humanitarian crises of unprecedented scale. Today’s crises cry out for urgent, bold and novel solutions. </p>
                  <p>In FHI 360’s 2018 annual report, we share some of the ways we are using cutting-edge research, technology-enabled approaches and entrepreneurial ingenuity to build resilient institutions and equip people to address major forces shaping the world &mdash; from preventing the spread of infectious disease, to preparing citizens for 21st-century jobs, to using digital technologies to improve decision-making and lower costs. Our goal is to enable people to make their lives and their communities healthier, safer and more prosperous. And because today’s challenges call for new types of solutions, we also introduce you to FHI Ventures, a new subsidiary that is part of our growing family of organizations built to create greater social impact. </p>
                  <p>We hope that when you meet the motorcycle taxi driver in Vietnam committed to staying healthy for his daughter and wife, the graduate student in Morocco building skills for a future career and the young man in the United States determined to make a fresh start, you will be as inspired as we are. And, you will see that when individuals, institutions and governments all work together, we are able to marshal our collective strengths in ways that make what seemed impossible, possible.</p>
                  <p>Our experience over the last year reinforces a simple truth: When people are given the chance to improve their lives and build their communities, they will seize the opportunity and contribute to a better future for all of us.</p>

                  <p>We live in an era of unprecedented prosperity with plenty of evidence of progress in addressing human development needs. Yet, global trends are placing many of these gains at risk. With the global population expected to reach 8 billion by 2023, it is easy to believe the world’s problems are too big to overcome.</p> 
                  <p>The impact of climate change looms larger every day, while the outbreak of deadly epidemics, political instability and crippling unemployment have given rise to a wave of humanitarian crises of unprecedented scale. Today’s crises cry out for urgent, bold and novel solutions. </p>
                  <p>In FHI 360’s 2018 annual report, we share some of the ways we are using cutting-edge research, technology-enabled approaches and entrepreneurial ingenuity to build resilient institutions and equip people to address major forces shaping the world &mdash; from preventing the spread of infectious disease, to preparing citizens for 21st-century jobs, to using digital technologies to improve decision-making and lower costs. Our goal is to enable people to make their lives and their communities healthier, safer and more prosperous. And because today’s challenges call for new types of solutions, we also introduce you to FHI Ventures, a new subsidiary that is part of our growing family of organizations built to create greater social impact. </p>
                  <p>We hope that when you meet the motorcycle taxi driver in Vietnam committed to staying healthy for his daughter and wife, the graduate student in Morocco building skills for a future career and the young man in the United States determined to make a fresh start, you will be as inspired as we are. And, you will see that when individuals, institutions and governments all work together, we are able to marshal our collective strengths in ways that make what seemed impossible, possible.</p>
                  <p>Our experience over the last year reinforces a simple truth: When people are given the chance to improve their lives and build their communities, they will seize the opportunity and contribute to a better future for all of us.</p>

                  <p>We live in an era of unprecedented prosperity with plenty of evidence of progress in addressing human development needs. Yet, global trends are placing many of these gains at risk. With the global population expected to reach 8 billion by 2023, it is easy to believe the world’s problems are too big to overcome.</p> 
                  <p>The impact of climate change looms larger every day, while the outbreak of deadly epidemics, political instability and crippling unemployment have given rise to a wave of humanitarian crises of unprecedented scale. Today’s crises cry out for urgent, bold and novel solutions. </p>
                  <p>In FHI 360’s 2018 annual report, we share some of the ways we are using cutting-edge research, technology-enabled approaches and entrepreneurial ingenuity to build resilient institutions and equip people to address major forces shaping the world &mdash; from preventing the spread of infectious disease, to preparing citizens for 21st-century jobs, to using digital technologies to improve decision-making and lower costs. Our goal is to enable people to make their lives and their communities healthier, safer and more prosperous. And because today’s challenges call for new types of solutions, we also introduce you to FHI Ventures, a new subsidiary that is part of our growing family of organizations built to create greater social impact. </p>
                  <p>We hope that when you meet the motorcycle taxi driver in Vietnam committed to staying healthy for his daughter and wife, the graduate student in Morocco building skills for a future career and the young man in the United States determined to make a fresh start, you will be as inspired as we are. And, you will see that when individuals, institutions and governments all work together, we are able to marshal our collective strengths in ways that make what seemed impossible, possible.</p>
                  <p>Our experience over the last year reinforces a simple truth: When people are given the chance to improve their lives and build their communities, they will seize the opportunity and contribute to a better future for all of us.</p>
