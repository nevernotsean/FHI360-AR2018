                  <p class="mb0"><strong class="uppercase">Kenza Elbouazzaoui<br>
                  Morocco</strong></p>
                  <p>There was a time when Kenza Elbouazzaoui, a graduate student in materials science engineering, worried about finding a job. In <strong>Morocco</strong>, more than 18 percent of university or vocational training graduates are unemployed, and young women face an even higher disadvantage. While graduates are eager to work, they do not know how to navigate the job market and find positions that match their competencies and interests. At the same time, employers cannot find candidates with the skills they need. This situation creates uncertainty for young jobseekers. Kenza was no exception. "I was scared," she said. "I didn't understand that jobs were even available."</p>
                  <h2>Bridging the gap between employers and youth</h2>
                  <p> The USAID Career Center project in Morocco has partnered with universities and technical and vocational education and training institutions to open six pilot centers on campuses in three cities, plus a virtual center to cater to those not enrolled in public institutions. These career centers prepare students for employment in high-growth sectors. Real-time, localized information about job market trends and opportunities is coupled with work readiness training, internships and networking opportunities that connect students and employers. To ensure that the needs of youth were met, youth were involved in building and branding the centers, designing facilities and developing services, all of which hold the youth who manage the centers accountable for the success of the centers.</p>
                  <p>This cutting-edge model uses data and industry-specific analyses from private-sector employment trends to develop curricula and services in a manner not offered before in Morocco. A defining feature is the significant role that businesses play in the design and delivery of activities, including "Sunrise Briefings," which provide a forum for employers to share their needs and industry insights with career centers and university faculty to respond better to labor market needs. This systems approach encourages stronger connections between the public and private sectors, educators, employers, government and youth.</p>
                  <h2>Practical skills for real-world jobs</h2>
                  <p>At the career center, Kenza obtained a better understanding of labor market demand and learned what resources were available, where to look for employment opportunities and how to use the center's job search tool to identify energy-sector positions relevant to her field of study &mdash; jobs that were difficult to find elsewhere. "Using the virtual tool, we can explore all the jobs that are available to us in our region. It [the tool] is very easy," she explained.</p>
                  <p>Center staff, predominantly youth themselves, take the time to get to know the students individually so that they can personalize services. Counselors host workshops and help students articulate their professional and personal goals. Career Center Youth Ambassadors, such as Kenza, support the centers in organizing events. Through their efforts encouraging their peers to take advantage of center services, youth ambassadors also build their own leadership and public-speaking skills. Kenza, for example, created and launched a "Digital Days" event for digital experts to share advice on jobs in that sector.</p>
                  <p>In Morocco, career centers are catching on. More than 86,000 students in 2018 used the career center services and almost 16,000 students completed workforce readiness training. The virtual career center logged more than 500,000 page views, and nearly 29,000 individuals registered with the site. The project worked in partnership with 126 companies or business organizations. Although the career centers are more focused on youth employability than job placement, a 2018 survey of virtual center users shows that more than 63 percent of respondents found a job or internship.</p>
                  <p>The career center experience can be transformative, helping students to understand career pathways, and the skills and education required to get there. Kenza now has a sense of direction and possibility, aiming to finish her studies and pursue a career in materials science in the energy sector.</p>

                  <p class="mb0"><strong class="uppercase">Christopher C.<br>
                  United States</strong></p>
                  <p>As a young boy, Christopher Collins showed promise. He loved to play sports, attended a gifted and talented program in middle school and graduated from high school. But growing up in a high-crime neighborhood in St. Louis stacked the deck against him. At 21 years of age, Christopher was arrested for gun possession and served 20 months in jail for a Class D felony. </p>
                  <p>Making it on your own can be daunting for any young adult in the <strong>United States</strong>. But, youth who have recently been incarcerated face staggering challenges. Many of them lack the safety net provided by family, friends and social services. With little or no work experience and a limited education, they struggle to find jobs. Employers often do not hire them after seeing their criminal records. This cycle of wanting a job but repeatedly being rejected makes them vulnerable to recidivism.</p>
                  <p>Chris did not know where to turn when he finished his sentence. He did not have a social security card or government-sponsored identification needed to get a job. "I was lost," he said. "It was like, who do you ask for help when you get out of jail?"</p>
                  <p>Then he met Tasha Robinson, who was recruiting youth participants for the Compass Rose Collaborative, which helps young people between the ages of 18 and 24 transition from the justice system into productive employment or education. "I gave them my number, and they actually called me back the next day. Ever since then, everything was easy, because I had a support system. I had a mentor."</p>
                  <h2>A pathway to productive employment</h2>
                  <p>Through Compass Rose, Chris participated in apprenticeships for building, carpentry and other skills. He learned how to create a budget and manage money and how to write a resume, dress for an interview and communicate with employers about his background and qualifications. He credits Tasha, his mentor, for pushing him &mdash; for never giving up on him.</p>
                  <p>Launched in 2017 and now active in eight U.S. cities, Compass Rose recruits youth from neighborhoods with crime and poverty rates exceeding 30 percent. The young participants are given options to pursue their education, gain vocational skills or seek employment. They also receive assistance with basic needs, such as housing, food assistance, transportation, child care and legal services, and access to a caring adult to provide support along their journey. FHI 360 leads Compass Rose and coordinates partners, activities and action plans across all sites. In St. Louis, for example, Compass Rose works in partnership with SLATE (the St. Louis Agency on Training and Employment), which conducts the program activities available to Chris.</p>
                  <p>By the end of 2018, halfway through the grant, data from the first three cities that participated in the collaborative showed that of the 375 young people who participated, 64 percent received job skills training, 25 percent held apprenticeships and 30 percent earned a vocational certification. Almost 50 percent of participants have gone on to further education or employment. The program will serve more than 1,100 young people by 2021.</p>
                  <p>Chris now has a full-time job as a machine operator but dreams of being an entrepreneur. He is also focused on being a good father to his daughter, who was born in December 2018.</p>
                  <p>"I have a lot of ideas," he said. "I am just trying to get a start."</p>
                  <p><em style="font-size: 85%;">The Compass Rose Collaborative is funded through the U.S. Department of Labor's Reentry Project. The $4.5 million federal award supports work in Hartford, CT; St. Louis, MO; and Los Angeles, CA. Local funding also supports the project.</em></p>

                  <p class="mb0"><strong class="uppercase">Yemen</strong></p>
                  <p>The civil war in <strong>Yemen</strong> has persisted for four years and resulted in the world's worst humanitarian disaster, with roughly 4 of 5 Yemenis in urgent need of assistance. The conflict has caused widespread food insecurity and malnutrition, further straining the basic health care system to the breaking point.</p>
                  <p>In 2018, FHI 360 began working with communities near the front lines of the conflict. Our assessments identified a severe need for assistance in the coastal western districts of Dhubab, Al Mokha and Al Khawkhah. Until recently, these areas were inaccessible to international organizations. </p>
                  <p>FHI 360's integrated approach is well suited to humanitarian emergencies and to fostering collaboration with community stakeholders, the United Nations, and government institutions to identify and prioritize needs.  </p>
                  <p>Our first priority in Yemen was to restore access to critical primary health care services, starting by rehabilitating the Al Ghaded Health Center in Ta'iz, a facility that had been partially destroyed and was unable to function. Simultaneously, FHI 360 worked with the Al Mokha and Al Khawkhah Maternal and Child Health centers to meet rapidly increasing demand because of the influx of internally displaced people and lack of technical, financial and administrative support from the central government.  </p>
                  <p>Our assistance included ensuring the availability of qualified health workers; building technical capacity of health staff, including training midwives, nurses and clinicians on topics such as basic emergency obstetric and newborn care and community management of acute malnutrition; providing essential medicines; upgrading cold chain capacity; and improving water supply, sanitation and waste management systems.  </p>
                  <h2>From crisis to resilience</h2>
                  <p>FHI 360 is committed to drawing upon our depth and breadth of experience in building local capacities and evidence for long-term development solutions. We apply lessons learned in international development work to create pathways for crisis-affected communities to initiate recovery and build resilience. Our work in Yemen continues to build a bridge between emergency response and long-term recovery.</p>

                  <p class="mb0"><strong class="uppercase">Vietnam</strong></p>
                  <p>Business is good for 38-year-old <span style="background:red;">Nguyen Van Huy.</span>* A motorbike taxi driver, Huy weaves and honks through the clogged streets of Hanoi. He makes around 5 million Vietnamese dong per month (US $215), enough to support his wife and nine-year-old daughter. "I feel I have a normal life," says Huy. </p>
                  <p>It has been 10 years since Huy received the news that he had HIV, which he believes he contracted from injecting drugs. "I was very sick at that time," says Huy, who was put on lifesaving antiretroviral therapy (ART) that he continues to take today. </p>
                  <p>People with HIV need lifelong treatment, but those who start ART early and stay on treatment are better able to lead healthy lives and unlikely to transmit HIV, which is critical to managing the epidemic. <strong>Vietnam</strong> has one of the lowest HIV prevalence rates (0.23 percent) among countries receiving support from the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) but is home to nearly a quarter million people living with HIV, with a large portion of infections concentrated among key populations, including people who inject drugs. Of the 132,000 people living with HIV and on treatment in Vietnam, 94 percent have suppressed viral loads, which eliminates the likelihood of sexually transmitting HIV. </p>
                  <h2>A roadmap for sustainability</h2>
                  <p>For years, ART has been offered in Vietnam free of charge via international aid, much of it through PEPFAR. As Vietnam’s economy grows and becomes less dependent on aid, the government has developed a transition plan to manage its HIV care and treatment services and to finance 100 percent of the cost of ART by 2020, using social health insurance (SHI) and provincial budgets.</p>
                  <p>Key goals in the transition included revising the social health insurance law and benefits package to cover funding for HIV treatment and integrate HIV clinics into the public health system, as well as procuring antiretroviral medications though the SHI program and creating procedures for HIV services reimbursement. The number of HIV patients enrolled in SHI increased from 40 percent in 2014 to 90 percent by the end of 2018.</p>
                  <p>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has supported this transition through the Sustainable HIV Response from Technical Assistance (<a href="https://www.fhi360.org/projects/sustainable-hiv-response-technical-assistance-shift" target="_blank">USAID SHIFT</a>) project. USAID SHIFT builds upon the success of the Sustainable Management of the HIV/AIDS Response and Transition to Technical Assistance (<a href="https://www.fhi360.org/news/hiv-project-vietnam-improved-patient-treatment-and-health-system" target="_blank">SMART-TA</a>) program, which transformed the way HIV prevention, care and treatment services are delivered in Vietnam.</p>
                  <p>The project has partnered with provincial leaders to develop roadmaps to ensure that health facilities become certified to deliver SHI-eligible services. The project conducts rigorous quality assessments and financial analyses of health facility expenditures and personnel to identify cost-efficiencies and staffing needs. Doctors, nurses, lab technicians, counselors and pharmacists are trained to ensure patients understand the importance of SHI and enroll. Patients receive support developing individual continuation treatment plans to ensure they adhere to their treatment regimens. These plans are regularly updated and include SHI as key to ensuring sustainable care.</p>
                  <p>USAID also developed national guidelines for data collection and is upgrading the national health information system for improved monitoring of the epidemic and social health insurance usage. Separate data systems for outreach, testing, treatment and SHI enrollment are now linked to ensure people who need services receive them. As a result of USAID SHIFT support, health providers can now access accurate and timely data through dashboards.</p>
                  <p>Now, Huy has successfully enrolled in SHI and will continue to receive his ARVs for free.  "Today, I feel good and my health is much improved," he says. "I always have hope there will be a cure for HIV, but until that time, I will continue to take my medications so I can stay healthy for my daughter and wife."</p>

                  <p class="mb0"><strong class="uppercase">Jane Nyathi<br>
                  Zimbabwe</strong></p>
                  <p>Girls and young women can be powerful agents for change, but far too many are denied opportunities to develop the self-confidence that is key to taking control of their destinies.</p>
                  <p>Jane Nyathi is not one of them. The 24-year-old is an assistant program officer for the Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored and Safe Women (DREAMS) public-private <a href="https://www.pepfar.gov/partnerships/ppp/dreams/" target="_blank">partnership</a> in Zimbabwe.</p>
                  <p>Based in Bulawayo, <strong>Zimbabwe's</strong> second largest city, Jane, along with her colleagues, focuses on reducing new HIV infections among adolescent girls and young women ages 15 to 24 in six high-HIV-burden districts.</p>
                  <p>Through DREAMS, FHI 360 delivers a comprehensive curriculum that focuses on HIV prevention, positive gender norms and building social assets, including social safety nets through mentors, peer groups, civic engagement and access to health information and services. The curriculum is targeted toward adolescent girls and young women and their sexual partners.</p>
                  <p>The need is great, and obstacles for young women, who should be looking toward the future with hope and optimism, can seem insurmountable. Poverty, gender inequality, sexual violence, social isolation, and limited schooling increase adolescent girls' and young women's vulnerability to HIV. "Young women in Zimbabwe are sometimes in relationships so that they can survive," said Jane. "It is difficult in Zimbabwe for you to even have a dollar to spend on anything or to buy credit for your phone."</p>
                  <h2>Building confidence and skills</h2>
                  <p>Jane has daily conversations with adolescent girls about how to access sexual and reproductive health and HIV services. She talks with community leaders about changing the gender norms and stigmas attached to using reproductive health services. She works with educational service providers who help adolescent girls go back to school or receive vocational training. And, she also helps adolescent girls develop their own income-generating activities.
                  </p>
                  <p>"My hope is that each and every girl in Zimbabwe will have the opportunity to fully reach her highest potential in life," said Jane. "If they are able to be independent, to be financially stable, to be who they want to be, I believe that we will have a better Zimbabwe."</p>
                  <p>In fiscal year 2018, FHI 360 reached about 42,500 adolescent girls in school and about 76,000 adolescent girls out of school with information on HIV prevention and gender norms. More than 22,000 community members received HIV prevention services.</p>
                  <p>Jane is an example of how empowering girls unleashes unlimited possibilities. She started with the program as a member of a DREAMS club in 2016, was hired by FHI 360 as a district facilitator and has been promoted to her current position. "DREAMS is what I am today," she said. "The program has made me want to make so many changes in other people's lives."  </p>
                  <p>This past year, Jane demonstrated her leadership on a global stage. At the 2018 International Conference on Family Planning in Rwanda, Jane spoke for the 600 youth who attended the conference and offered her views on the importance of investments in family planning. Said Jane of the experience, "It was just the beginning of all of my dreams."</p>

                  <p class="mb0"><strong class="uppercase">Laos</strong></p>
                  <p>Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) &mdash; often caused by parasites, mosquitoes and worms&mdash; affect the health of more than one billion people worldwide, causing pain, disability and, in some cases, death. For many NTDs, annual one-dose treatments and education around healthy behavior can make a dramatic impact &mdash; one that is highly cost-effective. In Laos, FHI 360 has been working with the government to control and eliminate the country's most prevalent NTDs.  </p>
                  <p><strong>Lymphatic filariasis</strong> (commonly known as elephantiasis): FHI 360 assisted the Ministry of Health in conducting the annual mass drug administration in Attapu Province, the only one in Laos where lymphatic filariasis was endemic. Due to the success of this effort, the World Health Organization confirmed that Laos is close to eliminating lymphatic filariasis and may now shift away from expensive mass treatment campaigns.  </p>
                  <p><strong>Schistosomiasis</strong> (commonly known as snail fever): An integrated public health and education approach is supporting ongoing efforts to control this disease. In a collaboration between the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health, FHI 360 supported the training 143 school teachers as part of the schistosomiasis control program in Champasak Province, where the disease is endemic. The teachers learned how to promote healthy prevention behaviors and ways to support mass drug administrations.  </p>
                  <p><strong>Soil-transmitted helminthes</strong> (hookworm, roundworm and whipworm): A partnership with the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education and Sport supported a school-based deworming program for about two million children ages 6 to 14 years. FHI 360 organized trainings that prepared 3,000 teachers and principals in nine provinces to work with children and their parents to prevent and treat the disease.  </p>
                  <p>FHI 360 also worked with the Ministry of Health to strengthen its capacity to manage the national NTD program, including the development of work plans, budgets and reports to ensure sustainable funding and effective systems to assess the impact of program activities. </p>

                  <p>In Nigeria's northwest states of Katsina and Zamfara, fewer than one-quarter of children can read a single word. Children without basic reading and math skills are less likely to finish school and hold jobs.</p>
                  <p>That is changing since the Reading and Numeracy Activity (RANA) project introduced Hausa language teaching materials in grades 1-3.  RANA also equips teachers with new techniques, engages local governments in school oversight, and mobilizes parents to be involved in their children's education.</p>
                  <p>In 2018, the Katsina and Zamfara state governments adopted the <em>Hausa Early Grade Reading Implementation Guideline</em>, which outlines state education authorities' responsibility for supporting Hausa literacy. FHI 360 collaborated with local government and community organizations to develop the guidelines. The Katsina state government has printed and distributed more than 353,000 RANA-authored student workbooks.</p>
                  <p>The impact of teaching early grade reading is clear: During the 2017–2018 school year, RANA students showed a 47 percent improvement in letter-sound recognition and the percentage of students who could not read one word decreased by 15 percent. The percentage of girls with basic literacy skills increased from 29 percent to more than 55 percent from 2015 to 2018. The project is expanding to four additional states &mdash; Bauchi, Kebbi, Niger and Sokoto.</p>

But, without funding and support, good ideas are unlikely to become profitable businesses that reach those who benefit from new products and services.</p>
                  <p>In 2018, FHI 360 launched FHI Ventures, a for-profit impact investing subsidiary dedicated to accelerating the growth of early-stage social enterprises that employ commercial strategies for improvements in development. FHI Ventures invests capital into a small group of companies, aligned with FHI 360's mission, to position them to attract further funding and expand the reach of their products. FHI Ventures also offers individualized coaching and advisory support to develop business strategy, raise capital and manage growth. FHI 360's global reach provides an opportunity to source viable business innovations and attract potential investors.</p>
                  <p>FHI Ventures selected five companies for the inaugural group through a highly competitive process. These early stage companies offer novel products designed to solve pressing development challenges: the spread of infectious disease and lack of clean water and basic sanitation. FyodorBio makes a urine test that can rapidly diagnose malaria, and UrSure produces a patient-friendly urine test that supports adherence to HIV prevention drugs. Sanivation provides sanitation services that transforms human waste into affordable fuel, and SweetSense makes remote sensors that improve the reliability of public water utilities in emerging economies. The fifth company, Mark Labs, offers a tool to improve better decision-making in the human development sector through a technology platform that quantifies social impact for investors.  </p>
                  <h2>Investments that can change the world  </h2>
                  <p>Since entering the FHI Ventures program, all five companies have experienced measurable business growth, have cumulatively raised an additional US$1.6 million thus far and are actively pursuing partnership opportunities to scale into new markets. Describing the impact that participating in the program has had on his company, Giffin Daughtridge, Chief Executive Officer of UrSure, said, "While the [financial] investment is great, the amount of additional resources and the network that comes with being part of the FHI 360 family have proved to be an accelerator for us in every sense of the word."</p>
                  <p>FHI 360 continues to partner with the inaugural portfolio companies, and selection of the next round of FHI Ventures investments is underway.  </p>

                  <h1 class="drawer-title">Groundbreaking contraceptive technologies</h1>
                  <p>More than 200 million women living in low-income regions of the world do not want to become pregnant but are not using effective contraceptive methods. For some of these women, access to contraception is limited; for others, available methods are not acceptable or affordable. FHI 360's research is creating important <strong>global</strong> inroads in expanding access to quality, affordable and acceptable new contraceptive methods for those most in need. </p>
                  <p>Since 2013, FHI 360's work under our Contraceptive Technology Innovation (CTI) Initiative has strived to advance the development and evaluation of game changing innovations that offer safe, effective, low-cost, easy-to-use and appealing contraceptives to women with the greatest need around the world. The work focuses on existing technology gaps by developing products with attributes that women want but are not available among current family planning options.</p>
                  <p>In 2018, the research continued to focus on creating novel contraceptive options by adapting innovative drug delivery platforms being studied for other therapeutic areas &mdash; including a biodegradable microneedle patch, biodegradable implants and longer-acting self-injectables. CTI is also evaluating a smaller copper intrauterine device. Collaboration with product development scientists at universities, small biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and manufacturing groups and service delivery organizations, is a hallmark of our inclusive research model that quickly moves innovative ideas through development to production.</p>
                  <p>FHI 360 also continues to generate evidence to determine how expanded access to the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) &mdash; a safe, long-acting, highly effective contraceptive &mdash; could potentially increase contraceptive choice for women in developing countries. The LNG-IUS is already popular among women in many high-income countries and provides both contraceptive and noncontraceptive benefits. FHI 360 is expanding information to increase funders' and decision-makers' understanding of the potential value of adding the LNG-IUS to the contraception choices women have in sub-Saharan Africa. The information could also help inform national introduction and scale-up plans.</p>

                  <p>Timely access to quality health care is critical in an emergency. Every minute counts when saving a life.</p>
                  <p>Researchers at FHI 360 generated complex geospatial models in a geographic information system (GIS) for <strong>Mozambique</strong> and <strong>Ethiopia</strong> to calculate travel times to community and regional emergency obstetric and newborn care services. Through this modeling, FHI 360 analyzed the distance women must travel to emergency obstetric and newborn care facilities to provide policymakers with accurate information about women'’'s travel time. The mapped results showed vast disparities in access, such as demonstrating that roughly a quarter of the population in both countries is more than five hours from lifesaving services. They then modeled improvement scenarios in GIS to show where upgrading facilities, adding ambulances and improving communications could curb maternal and newborn mortality.</p>

                  <p>Technology is changing the way we make decisions by providing managers with real-time facility level information. FHI 360 is working with governments to harness the power of new digital tools to troubleshoot complex issues, rapidly remediate problems and allocate resources wisely.</p>
                  <p>In <strong>Tanzania</strong>, FHI 360 is using the m360 School Information System (SIS) &mdash; an open-source Android-based solution &mdash; to facilitate onsite data collection, analysis and real-time data visualizations and reports for schools. The m360 SIS collects current information on classroom performance and attendance along with the ability for geographic information system (GIS) mapping and verification. Daily data capture, interactive dashboards and automated alerts and notifications support teachers and principals in monitoring and managing resources.</p>
                  <p>The m360 SIS works offline and uses short-message service (SMS) technology to transfer data in remote areas, providing complete coverage and helping policymakers to make data-driven decisions to support student success. During 2018, the use of the m360 SIS in Tanzania increased from 4,000 to 8,000 schools, serving nearly 4 million students. In addition, FHI 360 deployed m360 SIS to about 400 schools in <strong>Zanzibar</strong>, reaching as many as 200,000 students.</p>
                  <p>The m360 SIS is a customizable system built on FHI 360'’'s open-source mobile platform.</p>
