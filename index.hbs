                                    a chemical reaction. When applied to human development, a catalyst is the spark that
                                    transforms an idea into a solution.

                                    In this year’s annual report, we share some of the many ways FHI 360 is working with partners to catalyze positive change
                                    in the United States and around the world. Together, we are taking on some of the toughest
                                    human development challenges: curbing the spread of HIV and tuberculosis, improving nutrition
                                    and reducing stunting, preparing students for 21st-century jobs, helping small businesses
                                    grow, and more. Each collaboration unleashes new ideas and opportunities, strengthening
                                    our collective capacity to affect change. When the momentum gets going, change is unstoppable.

                                    While a catalyst remains unchanged by the chemical reaction it sets off, FHI 360 staff in more than 60 countries around the

                                    As you read about people working to change their lives and the world — the beekeeper with a dream to expand her small business,
                                    the policymaker with a vision to bring good nutrition to everyone in his country, the
                                    educator committed to ensuring that students in her home state succeed — we hope you

                                <p>As a young girl in Jordan, Samira Saeed Mouawwad watched her neighbors tend to their bees
                                    and pull the honey from the hives. Over the years, her interest in beekeeping grew. When
                                    Mouawwad and her husband began to struggle financially, she decided to transform her
                                    childhood interest into a business. “I took many training courses before I was able to
                                    master beekeeping,” says Mouawwad. “Now I import bees from abroad, nurture them, grow
                                    them and make pure honey.”
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Mouawwad, who is one of the first women in her community to earn a living from beekeeping, improved her business skills when
                                    she participated in the USAID Jordan Local Enterprise Support (LENS) home-based business
                                    training. With new skills and confidence, Mouawwad was able to take her business to the
                                    next level.

                                    Mouawwad learned food safety, packaging and marketing tips to connect with customers. “The topic I found most valuable was
                                    food safety, because it’s something home-based business owners often neglect and know
                                    little about,” she says. “My products are now tested and comply with food safety standards
                                    and regulations.”

                                    LENS helps businesses like Mouawwad’s by focusing on specific areas of private-sector demand, including food processing,
                                    transportation and logistics, and tourism. The project provides support through grants
                                    to businesses and works to improve access to institutional financing and increase investment
                                    opportunities. Support to professional associations builds their capacity to provide
                                    services and training for their members. LENS also focuses on targeted policy reforms,
                                    such as simplifying the business registration process, that encourage the growth of small
                                    businesses.

                                    Many home-based businesses are run exclusively by women, yet women entrepreneurs face more challenges than their male counterparts.
                                    LENS is empowering women like Mouawwad to create their own opportunities and map a future
                                    for themselves that they might not have thought possible. “The focus on small and home-based
                                    businesses is giving women the tools they need to become more powerful and independent,
                                    and this leads to their greater contribution to the economy,” says Mouawwad. “I’ve seen
                                    the impact on me and other women, and it’s remarkable.”

                                    Mouawwad, who hopes to export her honey to other countries, has mentored and inspired other women in Zarqa to pursue beekeeping.
                                    She offers them encouragement and assists them with turning their own ideas into stand-alone

                                    LENS hit a milestone in 2017 by reaching more than 10,000 micro and small enterprises through grants, technical assistance,

                                <p>One of the greatest barriers to ensuring that antiretroviral drugs for pre-exposure prophylaxis
                                    (PrEP) are effective in people who are at higher risk of acquiring HIV is the need to
                                    take a pill for PrEP every day consistently. Making progress on ending the global HIV
                                    epidemic hinges on providing multiple options for HIV prevention, especially options
                                    that do not require daily regimens.

                                    FHI 360 serves as the Leadership and Operations Center for the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN), a global, collaborative,
                                    clinical trials network that develops and tests the safety and efficacy of HIV prevention
                                    interventions. HPTN launched the first global trial of cabotegravir (

                                    <b>HPTN 077 study data released in 2017 showed that injectable cabotegravir is safe and
                                        well-tolerated, and the study dose stays in the bloodstream at levels expected to
                                        be protective when injections are administered every eight weeks.</b> The study and
                                    data analysis will continue until July 2018.

                                    Long-acting injectable cabotegravir could provide an easier, more practical alternative to the current regimen of daily oral
                                    tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine for PrEP. This option could help bring us
                                    closer to controlling the HIV epidemic.

                                <p>Yatin Thakur is a young Indian “serial entrepreneur” with big ambitions. Just 30 years old,
                                    he has already founded Startup India Advisory, a collective aimed at fostering entrepreneurship,
                                    and CoworkIn, a company that caters to a new generation of Indian entrepreneurs by providing
                                    affordable co-working spaces throughout New Delhi. This is in addition to founding seven
                                    other start-ups focused on wireless technology, media and bridging India’s rural-urban
                                    divide.

                                    Thakur and five other Indian technology entrepreneurs visited the United States as part of an International Visitor Leadership
                                    Program (IVLP) called “Showcasing the American Technological Experience.” For 22 days,
                                    they traveled to six cities — Boston, Kansas City, Manchester (New Hampshire), New York
                                    City, Salt Lake City and Washington (DC) — where they took a firsthand look at e-governance
                                    initiatives, broadband access in rural areas and the use of big data in high-density
                                    U.S. cities. They also met with financiers to discuss how to gain investors and create
                                    the infrastructure for the next generation of technology tools.

                                    Every year, IVLP brings emerging foreign leaders like Thakur to the United States for short-term visits where they can interact
                                    with U.S. counterparts to increase mutual understanding, share ideas and opportunities,
                                    and forge relationships.

                                    Thakur says the knowledge he gained from the IVLP experience fundamentally changed his vision for his business as well as
                                    how he engages with government and business clients. “When you’re doing work in your
                                    country, you’re usually based in one city and you’re just thinking about your nearby
                                    surroundings and your local community,” he said. “The visit allowed me to figure out
                                    solutions from a broader lens and helped me think about how my work could be more impactful
                                    in my local state as well as the country.”

                                    Before IVLP, Thakur operated two CoworkIn spaces in New Delhi. Now, he is in seven locations and plans to be in 20 spaces
                                    by the end of 2018. “My exposure to the U.S. environment showed me how to bring in the
                                    right people to work to achieve scale.”

                                    Thakur, who is also the managing director for India at the Global Entrepreneurship Network, intends to do all he can to promote
                                    India’s growing culture of entrepreneurship and the fast pace of digital innovation.
                                    Already, he has given a head start to many young Indian entrepreneurs and startups. “I

                                    supporting all its people,” he says. “I want to make sure every Indian succeeds and that
                                    the country prospers and makes the world proud.”

                                <p>An estimated 214 million women of reproductive age in low-income regions want to avoid pregnancy
                                    but are not using a modern contraceptive method. Hormonal contraceptive implants, introduced
                                    more than 30 years ago, are one of the most effective family planning methods available.
                                    Yet, until recently, access to implants has been limited in low-resource settings, largely
                                    because of the high cost of this method.
                                </p>

                                    FHI 360 has led a decade-long initiative that has been at the forefront of increasing access to high-quality, affordable
                                    implants.
                                    <b>In 2017, Sino-implant (II), a two-rod implant that is now marketed globally as Levoplant,
                                        was prequalified by the World Health Organization.</b> Prequalification means that
                                    the product is recognized as meeting international standards of quality, safety and efficacy
                                    and can now be procured by donors like the U.S. Agency for International Development.
                                    As part of this process, FHI 360 partnered with Shanghai Dahua Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.
                                    (Dahua), the manufacturer of Levoplant, to improve manufacturing quality systems, conduct
                                    clinical trials for prequalification and establish a global regulatory footprint and
                                    distribution platform.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    More than 1.5 million units of the product have been distributed globally through this initiative. By increasing competition
                                    in the implants market, the introduction of Levoplant has also helped reduce the price
                                    of other implant products, further increasing women’s access and helping countries achieve
                                    their goals under the Family Planning 2020 (FP2020) initiative. To achieve a sustainable
                                    business model, Dahua recently formed a partnership with DKT International, a nonprofit
                                    organization, to act as Dahua’s global distributor and announced further price reductions
                                    of Levoplant in FP2020 countries. This is an important step in expanding access to highly
                                    effective and affordable implants in additional markets.

                                <p>The Succeed 2020 project had a bold and ambitious goal: Support all North Dakota students
                                    to successfully transition from school to college and 21st century careers.

                                <p>
                                    Although students were enrolling in postsecondary education at a rate that outpaced the national average, they were not staying
                                    in school: North Dakota’s postsecondary completion rates for both two-year and four-year
                                    institutions fell below the national averages.
                                </p>

                                    Leading the charge for change were eight regional education associations that work with school districts, higher education
                                    institutions, state and local governments, businesses and community groups. To aid their
                                    efforts,
                                    <b>Succeed 2020 provided customized technical support and tools to generate data and research

                                        schools.

                                    For Jennifer Carlson, the project’s resources and technical support were crucial to transforming her region’s largely rural
                                    schools into ones that provide more rigorous academic and career and technical education
                                    programs, college and career counseling and support for students needing extra help.
                                    “The project really helped us to drill down and determine the best way to achieve the
                                    most goals within the fastest time,” said Carlson, the executive director of North Dakota’s
                                    Northeast Education Services Cooperative (NESC), one of the state’s regional education
                                    associations.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    NESC designed a system that consistently collects and analyzes data from both internal and external sources. The data system
                                    increased NESC’s capacity to identify gaps in services and supports and more effectively
                                    allocate resources in the region’s 22-member public, private and tribal school districts.
                                    Educators were offered professional development activities, while students had access
                                    to more rigorous curricula and college and career preparation activities, including virtual
                                    job shadowing and science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) camps.
                                </p>

                                    The impact of the five-year Succeed 2020 project can be seen across North Dakota. The number of students qualifying for state
                                    scholarships increased by 9 percentage points, from 15 percent to 24 percent. Succeed
                                    2020 also engaged North Dakota businesses: About 350 participated in career fairs during
                                    the 2016-17 school year, which informed students about career opportunities as well as
                                    the education needed to get those jobs. Among students participating in college and career
                                    readiness activities in the same academic year, 93 percent reported knowing more about
                                    careers, and 85 percent reported increased understanding of the importance of aligning
                                    course selections with career choices.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    With improved infrastructure at NESC, Carlson says her regional education association, along with the others that served
                                    as the project’s change agents, is now able to move forward using a data-driven perspective.
                                    This will help to ensure that schools are meeting the needs of their students, and the
                                    people who educate them, as they transition into their next chapter.

                                    “We’ve increased our organizational capacities, including our in-house education data system,” Carlson said. “Data is part
                                    of our culture now.”

                                    NESC was recently awarded a grant from the U.S. Department of Education, which will enable it to partner with three districts
                                    and the Spirit Lake tribe to build on college and career readiness efforts initiated

                                    <p>Tuberculosis (TB) is one of 10 leading causes of death worldwide: 1.7 million people
                                        died from the disease in 2016, according to the World Health Organization. TB is
                                        also treatable — and curable — but highly contagious. About 40 percent of TB cases
                                        worldwide are not treated by health systems and are defined as “missing.” Finding
                                        those missing cases is critical to TB control.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In Mozambique, where the number of new cases of TB remains high — 551 in 100,000 people infected each year —
                                        <b>FHI 360 is using CB-DOTS (community-based directly‐observed treatment, short course)
                                            to combat the disease in four provinces that account for 49 percent of the national
                                            TB burden: Nampula, Sofala, Tete and Zambézia.</b> Between 2015 and 2017, the
                                        proportion of TB patients detected through CB-DOTS activities increased from 12 percent
                                        to 36 percent of all TB patients detected in these provinces.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The CB-DOTS strategy involves training community health workers to increase awareness, detection and treatment of TB and
                                        brings services directly to the homes of those at risk for infection. Health workers
                                        observe patients swallowing each dose for six months and record and report cases
                                        and treatment outcomes. In addition, they encourage patients suspected of having
                                        TB to go to health units, where they are given sputum-smear microscopy tests, which
                                        increases early case detection and diagnosis. All family members are screened for
                                        TB and referred to appropriate treatment services.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In these most-affected provinces, FHI 360 convenes “monthly cough days,” where health facility teams visit remote areas to
                                        provide TB screening, specimen collection and other health services. Cough officers
                                        at health facilities are trained to identify patients and refer them to TB clinics.
                                        Guards and inmates at prisons, where TB is prevalent and spreads rapidly, are trained
                                        to detect cases and connect individuals to health services.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The CB-DOTS strategy also focuses on political commitment by national governments, which is central to implementing national
                                        TB strategies and programs. Tools and activities developed by FHI 360 are now being
                                        used by other health service providers in additional provinces in Mozambique as part
                                        of a national scale-up effort.

                                    Obey Assery, a trained economist and the Director of the Coordination of Government Business Department in the Prime Minister’s
                                    Office, played a pivotal role in building support for a more comprehensive approach to
                                    improving nutrition.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    “Nutrition was initially only really looked at as a health initiative,” said Assery, who worked in close collaboration with
                                    FANTA to strengthen and align government efforts on nutrition reform. “It’s now become
                                    a multisectoral issue, which requires everyone to be involved.”
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This change did not come quickly. Political commitment was essential to shift mindsets, and it took a concerted effort to
                                    increase awareness of the effects of malnutrition on national development and the need
                                    for multiple sectors to address it. Not only does malnutrition lead to underperformance
                                    in school, it reduces participation in the workforce and undermines economic growth and
                                    productivity, stunting not just individuals, but a country’s overall development.

                                    FANTA’s approach focused on supporting the Prime Minister’s Office and the Tanzania Food and Nutrition Centre to build individual
                                    and institutional capacity, mentor leaders, foster relations with community groups and
                                    strengthen coordination across sectors to increase the sustainability of nutrition programs.
                                    These efforts resulted in policy revisions and the launch of Tanzania’s first five-year
                                    Multisectoral Nutrition Action Plan (2016–2021).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    “We put together technical people from different sectors with a common agenda,” says Assery. “This meant bringing in the
                                    people from agriculture, from livestock, from water, from finance — people with different
                                    thinking to widen the scope and work together.”
                                </p>

                                    The FANTA project has also integrated and systematically scaled up nutrition assessment, counseling and support (NACS) into
                                    national strategies, local government plans, budgets and program guidelines; routine
                                    health service delivery; community-based programs; and HIV care and treatment, prevention
                                    of mother-to-child transmission and most-vulnerable children programs. Health managers,
                                    health care providers and community workers have been trained in the NACS approach. Training,
                                    job aids, practical assessment tools, registers, and monitoring and evaluation forms
                                    for service providers have been developed and distributed. By mid- 2017, NACS services
                                    were integrated into health facilities and community services in 22 of mainland Tanzania’s
                                    26 regions.
                                </p>

                                    <b>Healthier, more productive citizens</b>

                                    Using PROFILES, an evidenced-based model, FANTA led a multisectoral stakeholder process to estimate the impact of malnutrition
                                    on human capital, economic productivity and health outcomes. The estimates show that
                                    investing to reach nutrition targets over a ten-year period (2014–2025) will save hundreds
                                    of thousands of lives, reduce disabilities and result in significant economic gains in
                                    Tanzania.

                                    Tanzania was one of the first countries to put the NACS approach into operation and to emphasize a multisectoral approach
                                    to tackling nutrition problems. Says Assery, “Other countries are now seeking Tanzania’s
                                    help in creating models they can use to address similar issues and achieve similar results.”

                                <p>Decades-long conflict has stunted economic growth and development in Afghanistan. To rebuild
                                    their country and fully participate in its workforce, Afghans need access to quality
                                    higher education and vocational training that responds to the needs of employers and
                                    the realities of the job market.

                                    <b>The University Support and Workforce Development Program (USWDP), in partnership with
                                        Purdue University, is helping to link education programs to jobs by establishing
                                        a market-oriented bachelor degree program in food technology at the Herat University
                                        Faculty of Agriculture (HUFA).</b> In 2017, 15 third-year students from existing
                                    departments transferred into the new food technology department.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    “This department is the first food technology program in our country,” said Yosouf Jami, dean of HUFA, which is in western
                                    Afghanistan close to the border with Iran. “Graduates in this field can serve at the
                                    agriculture directorate and health department, work for companies in the food industry
                                    or go into other food-related areas.”
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Food technologists use science to create and improve food products. The HUFA curriculum covers the fundamentals of food technology
                                    while teaching applied, practical skills in food processing, food safety and product
                                    development. Upon graduation, students will receive help finding jobs. More than half
                                    of this year’s students are female, and the university is making plans to ensure that
                                    the next group of students has a similar gender balance.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    HUFA, Purdue University and USWDP developed the food technology program in close consultation with representatives of the
                                    food processing industry. The curriculum takes into account the unique challenges faced
                                    by Afghan companies and the skills graduates need to support food production and processing.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    “A lack of skilled employees is our biggest challenge in this sector,” explained Jami. Until now, people outside Afghanistan
                                    were needed for technical assistance. “We hope that graduates of this department will
                                    be able to meet industry needs. This is a major educational necessity in our country.”
                                </p>

                                    USWDP and Purdue University have worked closely since 2015 to design and implement the program. USWDP has taught students
                                    about basic research survey methodologies and supplied materials, such as the equipment
                                    and chemicals needed to establish a teaching laboratory. Members of the Purdue food science
                                    faculty visit regularly to provide training and assistance, and HUFA’s faculty have visited
                                    Purdue twice for intensive skills building in lab techniques. USWDP and Purdue are jointly
                                    supporting four HUFA faculty to obtain master’s degrees in food technology in India.
                                    These faculty expect to complete their studies in July 2018 and will return to assume
                                    leadership and teaching responsibilities in the food technology department. Jami is optimistic
                                    about the impact of this young program. “The food industry and other organizations will
                                    benefit,” said Jami. “When students graduate and enter society, they will bring the benefits
                                    from their recent study, and the industry will benefit from their professional knowledge
                                    and skills.”

                                    Eleven universities receive technical and financial support from USWDP, including the food technology program at Herat. Since
                                    it began four years ago, USWDP has established or supported 32 degree programs, including
                                    five newly established associate degrees, 18 bachelor’s degrees and eight master’s degrees.
                                    These programs, supported by the University of Massachusetts and other academic institutions
                                    in the U.S., provide students with some of the most sought-after degrees in Afghanistan.
                                    Examples of degree offerings include an associate’s degree in information technology,
                                    a bachelor’s degree in oil and gas and a master’s degree in education leadership and
                                    management. These programs are bringing the country closer to creating a technically
                                    qualified, professionally capable workforce.

                                    some of the world’s most pressing challenges has never been greater. In Liberia and Ghana,
                                    <b>FHI 360 is using technology to collect data to improve the quality and timeliness of
                                        decision-making, deliver better program outcomes and improve accountability. </b>

                                    FHI 360, in partnership with the Liberian government, is transforming the way its school staff and health care workers are
                                    paid. In the past, school staff needed to leave work and travel long distances to collect
                                    their salaries, costing them time and money and causing them to be away from their classrooms.
                                    In July 2016, 67 school staff began receiving their pay digitally by mobile money, an
                                    easily accessible substitute for cash. By the end of 2017, that number had climbed to
                                    more than 3,000 school staff and 800 health care workers in nearly all of Liberia’s counties.
                                    The Government of Liberia also benefits: It can distribute salaries more efficiently
                                    and transparently.
